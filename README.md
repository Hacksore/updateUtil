# How it works? 
**Tray Application (Runs as user)**

The GUI tray application is what the user will see. They can use this application to start the download and automated install of the macOS update.

**Daemon (Runs as root)**

This is what the GUI sends commands to in order for the standard user to execute binaries which require elevation.

# Running locally for development
Install the depencies and then you can start the application. 

``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app also requires the daemon to be running which you can start in development mode. Ensure you have ran the build command for the daemon `npm run build:daemon`.

```bash
./updateUtilDaemon --dev
```
Note: the binary is expected to be running as root so please make sure to invoke it as so.

# Building 
To build the app run the following npm command.

`npm run buildapp`

# Packaging 
To build a packaged installer run the following npm command.

`npm run pkg`
